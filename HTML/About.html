    <p>The potatoes we use to make our French fries are made from potatoes grown in North America by growers who are required to identify the genetic source of their seed potatoes. We do not work with genetically modified potato varieties. Our potatoes are processed fresh off the field and delivered to us without any modifications. We proudly serve Sir Kensington ketchup.</p>
